# cfd-dicom
Tools for converting CFD data to 4D dicom stacks
<br>To do:
<br> rewrite main.py to change how data are handled - more streamlined now becasse of scaling and pathlines. Should be straightforward to generate dicom stacks by simply indexing vti
<br> integrate functionality for partricle voxel tracking (i.e., merge testing_particle_voxelization.py into the rest of the package)
<br>conversion pipeline/automation, different scripts for rendering, metadata stuff, etc.. 
<br>scaling for q-criterion
<br>Pathline voxels-DONE 
<br>horos Movie export metadata 
<br> documentaiton and instructions
